 <div class="info">
<p> Slimes are gelatinous, ball-shaped, adorable alien creatures that live on the far away planet called the Far, Far Range. They are a key element within the game since they are responsible for the production of plorts that are used to make money, create gadgets, and unlock areas in the game. </p>

  <p>There are several different species of slimes, each found in certain locations on the Far, Far Range. Though their most common features are the permanent happy expressions they have on their faces when fed and their high pitched voices, each type of slime has a unique trait that is used to identify it. Nearly all pure slimes are capable of stacking.</p>
